The Aims class needs to be updated to properly handle any exceptions thrown when the play() methods are invoked. What will occur if these updates are not made?
If the exceptions are not handled, attempting to use the Aims class will result in the error: "The method play() from the type Playable refers to the missing type PlayerException".
